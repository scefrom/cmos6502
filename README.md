# CMOS6502

CMOS6502 is a lightweight efficient MOS 6502 emulator written in C by the 15 yo me. (expect some C newbie stuff).

It isn't cycles-accurate, and only has a clock() function which executes a single instruction.

It is able to pass Klaus2m5's functional_test (https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests/blob/master/6502_functional_test.a65)
